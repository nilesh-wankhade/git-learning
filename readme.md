## Git commands

Q. How to send some items to different address?
A - Generally, We take box add few item to it, then we seal it and we can write small note on it. We are adding note so other person should understand what it there in box without opening it.

- message===message
- how many item should person add in box is `git stagging`
- adding item to box is == git staging == `git add .`, `git add head/header.html`
- `git add .` - this command add all the files/items in box
- `git add head/header.html` - this command add only one file to the box.
- After adding file to the box how will you write messages?
- `git commit -m "created header file for project"`
- here commit is like box, commit == box, commit and box can have message as identity
- once box is packed with message === once commit is packed with message, you need to upload(push) it.
- So we never know if our code is latest or cloud code or code in drive or code in git or code in repo is latest, that why we should 1st download(pull) code from repo to our machine.
- How will you do that?
- use `git pull`
